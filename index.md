I'm Demi!

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student, studying at the University of Nottingham. My focuses are the 
intersection of data science, music theory and software engineering.

Generally though, I like creating things. That's mostly what I'll be doing here. I'll share the random thoughts that I have as a 20-something year old. Maybe some tech stuff. Though, [most of that is here](https://www.thetechiejournal.com/blog/).

Enjoy reading :)
