## I feel lost

I've been in full-time academia for most of my life. I don't really know anything outside of this.

Sure, I’ve done some cool things. I interned at Google at the start of my degree, thinking that it would launch me headfirst into a SWE career.

I was correct. What I wasn’t ready for was the change of mind.

4 years later, reaching the end of my computer science degree, I’m not sure I want this.

The money is good, and it sounds exciting. 

But truth be told, I’m not a very technical person to begin with.

Before all this, I wanted to study music at university. I’ve always loved music and I’ve had a strong talent in it since the age of 5. I wanted to pursue my musical passion and start performing at venues.

But I was faced with the reality of the struggling artist. Truth be told, I didn’t believe in myself enough. So, I decided to pivot into something more “employable”, Computer Science.

Whilst I don’t regret studying this degree, I don’t feel excited to pursue industry full-time.

From writing online, to creating videos and building this nice online community, I found that my creative talent wasn’t padlocked by music.

I could apply this creativity to new areas. 

• Crocheting
• Hairdressing
• Designing solutions that solve problems.

Ultimately, I’ve always been a creative.

But I don’t think that’s a job that exists in the corporate world.

Do I abandon that world? Do I accept that I’ll never truly fit in there?

I know there’s a world outside of corporate, where you can pursue your passions in the hopes that you get discovered online and offline.

But I’m pretty scared to go for it. 

I guess I’m not really lost.

I’m just in the wrong place.
